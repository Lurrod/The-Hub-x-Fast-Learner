"""
Balance 2 teams of 5 from 10 players.

Algorithm: optimal brute-force.
  - C(10,5) = 252 partitions, but we pin player 0 in team A to avoid
    symmetric duplicates -> C(9,4) = 126 candidates.
  - Primary score    : minimize |sum(A.elo) - sum(B.elo)|
  - Tie-breaker      : minimize |max(A.elo) - max(B.elo)| (no solo stack)
  - Tie-breaker 2    : lexicographic order of IDs (deterministic)

Complexity: O(126 * 10) ~= 1.3k operations. Well under a millisecond.
